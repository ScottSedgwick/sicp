; Exercise 1.27: Demonstrate that the Carmichael numbers listed in Footnote 1.47
; (Carmichael numbers: 561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821, 6601)
; really do fool the Fermat test. That is, write a procedure that takes an
; integer n and tests whether an is congruent to a modulo n for every a < n, and
; try your procedure on the given Carmichael numbers.

; Fermatâ€™s Little Theorem: If n is a prime number and a is any positive integer
; less than n, then a raised to the nth power is congruent to a modulo n.
; That is, a^n mod n == a
